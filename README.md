# Intelligent Cyber-Biological System (ICBS)

This repository is dedicated to the Intelligent Cyber-Biological System (ICBS), a sophisticated multi-layered MAPE-K structure designed to significantly enhance the analysis and real-time monitoring of organoids. Our work responds to the complex needs of organoid research, where these miniaturized and simplified versions of organs are used for disease modeling, drug testing, and personalized medicine.
