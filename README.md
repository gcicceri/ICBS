# Intelligent Cyber-Biological System (ICBS)

This repository is designed as a case study for the implementation of an Intelligent Cyber-Biological System (ICBS), a sophisticated multi-layered MAPE-K structure devoted to significantly enhance the analysis and real-time monitoring of organoids. Our work responds to the complex needs of organoid research, where these miniaturized and simplified versions of organs are used for disease modeling, drug testing, and personalized medicine. The repository contains the implementation of various machine learning models used in this study to classify intestinal organoids.  The project evaluates several shallow models like Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM),  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) to determine which performs best in the organoid classification. Within this repository are the main Python scripts (.ipynb files) to train and test the proposed ML models for the multiclassification task.

## Model Selection and Training 

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook scripts for each of the six machine learning models. To execute the ML models, please navigate to the **ML Models scripts** folder at the following link: [Download model scripts from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MI4qYO5oBwc_4jgWpmZqXoRaPakzwLTZ?usp=drive_link). These notebooks are designed to be run in Google Colab, which provides a powerful and interactive cloud-based environment equipped with GPU support to facilitate the training process. Simply open the desired model notebook in Colab and follow the instructions to initiate the training step.

## Evaluation

Upon completion of the training phase, our experiments allowed for the evaluation of the six ML model's performance via the included test dataset. This step was essential for verify the model's proficiency in accurately classifying organoid images.

The weights of the trained ML models are an essential part of the evaluation process and allow us to replicate our results. 
We have hosted the weights on Google Drive. You can download, after an formal e-mail request, the **ML models weights** from the following link: [Download model weights from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YCkYvgs4ZRPiwnvq89Uov5p-YTf3S3Y4?usp=drive_link). Please ensure you comply with any terms of use associated with the data and cite the appropriate paper references when using these weights in your work.
